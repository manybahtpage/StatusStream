# Get your Discord status, presence, and activities through the Web API

When you have a server that's essentially a dedicated server lying around idle and doing nothing, why not utilize it for this purpose?

- üòÇ Yes, it's like using Lanyard. It's a great project, so please go check it out.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è API cached by Cloudflare Edge (1 minute)
- ‚ö° Powered by Bun.js and Elysia.js
- ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Your Discord status will be updated every time your request does not hit the cache.
- üì® The information we get from Discord, we just pass through it just like that.
- üò≤ IT JUST WORKS!

## How to

1. Join this Discord server [StatusStream](https://discord.gg/Bu4rkbaE9f)
2. Get your discord status by using this link : https://statusstream.many.win/users/your-discord-id
For example: https://statusstream.many.win/users/311364847826763776

Cannot be more simple than this
